# üìä Performance History Time Range Fix

## Issue
Performance history chart showing "No data available" when "1H" (Last Hour) is selected, even though data exists for other time ranges.

---

## Root Cause

The time filtering logic was working correctly, but the issue was:

1. **No data in the selected time range** - If speed tests are scheduled every 30 minutes and only 1-2 tests have run, there might not be any data within the last hour
2. **Unclear messaging** - The "No data available" message didn't explain that data exists but not in the selected time range

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Debug Logging
Added console logging to help diagnose time range filtering issues:

```javascript
console.log(`Time Range: ${timeRange}`);
console.log(`Cutoff Time: ${cutoffTime.toISOString()}`);
console.log(`Current Time: ${now.toISOString()}`);
console.log(`Total History Items: ${history.length}`);
console.log(`Filtered Items: ${filtered.length}`);
console.log(`Oldest Item: ${history[0]?.timestamp}`);
console.log(`Newest Item: ${history[history.length - 1]?.timestamp}`);
```

This will show in the browser console (F12) exactly what's happening when you select different time ranges.

### 2. Improved "No Data" Message

**Before**:
```
No data available yet
Run a speed test or start monitoring to see results
```

**After**:
```
No data available for the last hour
Try selecting a longer time range (X total results available)
```

The new message:
- ‚úÖ Shows which time range is selected
- ‚úÖ Indicates how many total results exist
- ‚úÖ Suggests trying a longer time range

---

## How to Debug

### 1. Open Browser Console (F12)
Look for console logs showing:
```
Time Range: 1h
Cutoff Time: 2025-10-07T13:00:00.000Z
Current Time: 2025-10-07T14:00:00.000Z
Total History Items: 50
Filtered Items: 0
Oldest Item: 2025-10-06T10:00:00.000Z
Newest Item: 2025-10-07T12:45:00.000Z
```

### 2. Analyze the Output

**Example 1: No data in time range**
```
Total History Items: 50
Filtered Items: 0
Newest Item: 2025-10-07T12:45:00.000Z  ‚Üê Last test was 1h 15m ago
```
**Reason**: Last test was before the 1-hour cutoff  
**Solution**: Wait for next scheduled test or run a manual test

**Example 2: Tests too infrequent**
```
Cutoff Time: 2025-10-07T13:00:00.000Z  ‚Üê Looking for data after 1pm
Newest Item: 2025-10-07T12:45:00.000Z  ‚Üê Last test was at 12:45pm
```
**Reason**: Test interval is 30 minutes, only 15 minutes have passed  
**Solution**: Select "6H" range or wait for next test

**Example 3: Clock skew**
```
Current Time: 2025-10-07T14:00:00.000Z
Newest Item: 2025-10-07T16:00:00.000Z  ‚Üê Future timestamp!
```
**Reason**: System clock is wrong  
**Solution**: Fix system time

## Understanding Time Ranges

| Range | Cutoff | Typical Use Case |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **1H** | Last 60 minutes | Quick check of recent performance |
| **6H** | Last 6 hours | Morning/afternoon performance |
| **24H** | Last 24 hours | Daily trends |
| **7D** | Last 7 days | Weekly patterns |
| **All** | Everything | Full history |

### Test Frequency Impact

**Scenario 1: 30-minute intervals**
```
Tests at: 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 12:00, 12:30, 13:00
Current time: 13:15
Last hour (since 12:15): 12:30, 13:00 ‚Üí 2 data points ‚úÖ
```

**Scenario 2: 60-minute intervals**
```
Tests at: 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 13:00
Current time: 13:15
Last hour (since 12:15): 13:00 ‚Üí 1 data point ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

**Scenario 3: Just started monitoring**
```
Tests at: 13:10
Current time: 13:15
Last hour (since 12:15): 13:10 ‚Üí 1 data point ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

## Expected Behavior

### When Data Exists in Time Range
‚úÖ Charts display with data points  
‚úÖ Statistics show (Min/Avg/Max)  
‚úÖ X-axis shows time labels  
‚úÖ Hover shows tooltips

### When No Data in Time Range
‚úÖ Clear message: "No data available for the last hour"  
‚úÖ Helpful hint: "Try selecting a longer time range (X total results)"  
‚úÖ Total count shown if data exists elsewhere  
‚úÖ Alternative suggestion to run tests

---

## Quick Tests

### Test 1: Verify Time Filtering Works
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Select "All" time range ‚Üí Should show all data
3. Select "1H" ‚Üí Check console logs
4. Compare "Filtered Items" vs "Total History Items"
5. If filtered < total, filtering is working ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Verify New Message
1. Select "1H" when no recent data exists
2. Should see: "No data available for the last hour"
3. Should see: "Try selecting a longer time range (X total results)"
4. Click "6H" or "24H" ‚Üí Data should appear

### Test 3: Force Data in Range
1. Run a manual speed test (click "Run Speed Test")
2. Wait for completion (~30 seconds)
3. Select "1H" ‚Üí New test should appear in chart ‚úÖ

## Troubleshooting

### "No data available for the last hour" shows, but I just ran a test

**Check console logs**:
```javascript
Newest Item: 2025-10-07T13:00:00.000Z
```

**Possible causes**:
1. **Test still running** - Wait for completion
2. **Database not updated** - Refresh page (F5)
3. **WebSocket not connected** - Check connection status
4. **Timestamp timezone issue** - Check system time

### Charts not updating after speed test

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh page (F5)
2. Check backend console for errors
3. Verify WebSocket connection (should see "WebSocket connected" in console)
4. Check if monitoring is running

### All time ranges show "No data"

**Solutions**:
1. Select "All" time range
2. If still empty:
   - Run a manual speed test
   - Check if history was cleared
   - Verify backend is running
   - Check database file exists (`backend/monitoring.db`)
