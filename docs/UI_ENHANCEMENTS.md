- **Subtle Accent Glows**: Reduced glow opacity for a more refined dark aesthetic
- **Consistent Styling**: Both Dashboard and Settings pages now share the same dark aesthetic

### ⏰ Next Scheduled Test Display

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Statistics Section
- **What**: Completely removed the separate "Statistics" section that displayed min/max/avg values
- **Why**: Streamlined UI by integrating stats directly into chart headers
- **Location**: `Dashboard.js` - Removed statistics JSX block at bottom of component

### 1.1 ✅ Removed "vs previous" Labels
- **What**: Removed the "vs previous" text from percentage change indicators
- **Why**: Cleaner, more minimal design - the arrow and percentage are self-explanatory
- **Result**: Now shows just "↑ 5.2%" or "↓ 3.8%" without extra text

### 2. ✅ Added Min/Max/Avg to All Charts
- **What**: Each chart now displays min, max, and average values in the chart header
- **Charts Updated**:
  - Download Speed (Mbps)
  - Upload Speed (Mbps)
  - Ping Latency (ms)
  - Jitter (ms)
  - Download Latency (ms)
  - Upload Latency (ms)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `calculateStats()` function that computes min/max/avg for any data key
  - Added stat calculations for all 6 metrics
  - Created `.chart-title-row` to display title and stats side-by-side
  - Added `.chart-stats` container with colored stat badges
- **Styling**: 
  - Min badge: Cyan color (#06b6d4)
  - Avg badge: Purple color (#8b5cf6)
  - Max badge: Orange color (#f59e0b)

### 3. ✅ Added Percentage Change Indicators
- **What**: Speed cards now show % change compared to previous test result
- **Cards Updated**:
  - Download: Shows ↑/↓ with green (increase) or red (decrease)
  - Upload: Shows ↑/↓ with green (increase) or red (decrease)
  - Ping: Shows ↓/↑ with green (decrease) or red (increase) - reversed because lower is better
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `calculatePercentChange()` function
  - Added `getPreviousValue()` helper to get previous history entry
  - Calculates `downloadChange`, `uploadChange`, `pingChange`
  - Displays percentage with "vs previous" label
- **Styling**:
  - Positive changes: Green background with green text
  - Negative changes: Red background with red text
  - Rounded badges with borders

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Dark Mode Styling
- **Status**: Enhanced with deeper blacks and better contrast
- **Background**: 
  - Deep space black (#0a0e1a) with radial gradient overlays
  - Purple, violet, and green accent glows for depth
  - Creates immersive dark environment
- **Cards**: 
  - Darker semi-transparent backgrounds (rgba(20, 30, 48, 0.95))
  - Enhanced glassmorphism with stronger backdrop blur
  - Prominent shadows with colored glows
  - Better border contrast with rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.3)
- **Text**: 
  - High contrast light colors (#e2e8f0, #f1f5f9)
  - Clear readability against dark backgrounds
- **Accents**: 
  - Purple/indigo gradients (#6366f1, #8b5cf6)
  - Green for positive indicators (#10b981)
  - Red for negative indicators (#ef4444)
- **Effects**:
  - Enhanced backdrop blur for depth
  - Multiple layered shadows for 3D effect
  - Color-coded glows on interactive elements
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects
  - Improved percentage badges with stronger backgrounds

## Technical Details

### New Functions Added to Dashboard.js
```javascript
// Calculate min, max, avg for any metric
const calculateStats = (data, key) => {
  if (data.length === 0) return { min: 0, max: 0, avg: 0 };
  const values = data.map(item => item[key] || 0);
  return {
    min: Math.min(...values),
    max: Math.max(...values),
    avg: values.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / values.length
  };
};

// Calculate percentage change from previous value
const calculatePercentChange = (current, previous) => {
  if (!previous || previous === 0) return null;
  const change = ((current - previous) / previous) * 100;
  return change;
};

// Get previous value from history
const getPreviousValue = (key) => {
  if (history.length < 2) return null;
  return history[history.length - 2][key];
};
```

### New CSS Classes Added to Dashboard.css

#### Percentage Change Indicators
- `.percentage-change`: Container for change display
- `.percentage-change.positive`: Green styling for positive changes
- `.percentage-change.negative`: Red styling for negative changes
- `.change-label`: "vs previous" label styling

#### Chart Stats Display
- `.chart-title-row`: Flex container for title and stats
- `.chart-stats`: Container for stat badges
- `.stat-badge`: Base styling for stat badges
- `.stat-badge.min`: Cyan styling for minimum value
- `.stat-badge.avg`: Purple styling for average value
- `.stat-badge.max`: Orange styling for maximum value
- `.stat-unit`: Unit label styling (Mbps, ms)

## File Restoration Note

During implementation, `Dashboard.js` became corrupted when attempting to update multiple charts simultaneously. The file was successfully restored by:
1. Identifying the corrupted section (lines 1-40)
2. Manually reconstructing the proper state declarations
3. Sequentially updating the Download Latency and Upload Latency charts
4. Verifying no compilation errors remained

## Testing Checklist

Before deployment, verify:
- [ ] All 6 charts display min/max/avg stats
- [ ] Speed cards show percentage change after second test
- [ ] Percentage change indicators show correct colors:
  - [ ] Download/Upload: Green for increase, red for decrease
  - [ ] Ping: Green for decrease (better), red for increase (worse)
- [ ] Statistics section is completely removed
- [ ] Dark theme is consistent across all elements
- [ ] Charts remain responsive at different screen sizes
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools

## Screenshots Location
Consider adding before/after screenshots to this directory for documentation.

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for consideration:
- Add percentage change to Jitter display
- Add trend indicators (improving/declining over time)
- Add configurable stat display preferences
- Add export functionality for stats data
