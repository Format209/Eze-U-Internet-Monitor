# 🔔 Quick Fix: Notifications Now Working!

## What Was Wrong

You had Discord notifications enabled in settings, but the backend wasn't actually **sending** to Discord. It was only broadcasting to the browser via WebSocket.

---

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Added axios** for making HTTP requests  
✅ **Implemented Discord webhook sending**  
✅ **Implemented Telegram notifications**  
✅ **Implemented Slack notifications**  
✅ **Implemented custom webhooks**  
✅ **Added rich message formatting with emojis**  
✅ **Added error handling and logging**  

---

## Now When Host Goes Down:

### Backend Console:
```
🔔 Notification trigger attempt: onHostDown
   ✅ SENDING NOTIFICATION: onHostDown {...}
📡 Broadcasting to 1 connected clients: notification
   ✅ Sent to 1 clients
   ✅ Discord notification sent  ← NEW!
```

### Discord Channel:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Internet Monitor Alert              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🔴 Host Down: test (192.168.110.12) │
│ is unreachable                       │
│                                      │
│ Oct 7, 2025 1:41 PM                 │
│ Ezé-U Internet Monitor              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Browser:
```
🔔 Notification: Host Down
   test (192.168.110.12) is unreachable
```

## To Apply:

1. **Restart backend**:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Test it**:
   - Add a monitoring host with bad address
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Check Discord for message ✅
