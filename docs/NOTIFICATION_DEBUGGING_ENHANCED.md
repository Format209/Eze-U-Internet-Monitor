# 🔔 Enhanced Notification Flow Debugging

## Issue

Browser notifications stopped appearing even though Discord notifications were working. Need to ensure notifications are sent to **all enabled channels** including browser.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Added Comprehensive Debug Logging

#### Backend (`server.js`):
- ✅ Log formatted message
- ✅ Log when broadcasting to browser clients
- ✅ Log notification flow completion
- ✅ Log connected WebSocket clients count

#### Frontend (`App.js`):
- ✅ Log notification received with full data
- ✅ Log settings status (enabled, browser enabled, permission)
- ✅ Log when notifications are blocked by settings
- ✅ Log when attempting to show browser notification
- ✅ Log when notification is actually shown
- ✅ Log permission requests and denials
- ✅ Log when browser doesn't support notifications

---

## Complete Notification Flow

### Step 1: Event Detected (Backend)
```javascript
// Example: Host goes down
triggerNotification('onHostDown', {
  host: 'Router',
  address: '192.168.1.1',
  timestamp: '2025-10-07T16:30:00.000Z'
});
```

**Backend Console**:
```
🔔 Notification trigger attempt: onHostDown
   Notification settings: {...}
   ✅ SENDING NOTIFICATION: onHostDown {...}
   📝 Formatted message: 🔴 Host Down: Router (192.168.1.1) is unreachable
```

### Step 2: Send to External Channels (Backend)
```javascript
sendToNotificationChannels(...)
```

**Backend Console**:
```
   ✅ Discord notification sent
   (or other channels if enabled)
```

### Step 3: Broadcast to Browser (Backend)
```javascript
broadcast({
  type: 'notification',
  event: 'onHostDown',
  data: {...}
})
```

**Backend Console**:
```
   📡 Broadcasting to browser clients...
📡 Broadcasting to 1 connected clients: notification
   ✅ Sent to 1 clients
   ✅ Notification flow complete
```

### Step 4: Receive via WebSocket (Frontend)
```javascript
websocket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // ...
  case 'notification':
    handleNotification(message.event, message.data);
}
```

**Browser Console**:
```
📨 WebSocket message received: notification {...}
🔔 Notification received: onHostDown {...}
   Settings: {
     notificationsEnabled: true,
     browserEnabled: true,
     soundEnabled: true,
     permission: "granted"
   }
```

### Step 5: Check Settings & Permission (Frontend)
```javascript
if (!settings?.notificationSettings?.enabled) return;
if (!settings?.notificationSettings?.types?.browser?.enabled) return;
```

**Browser Console (if blocked)**:
```
   ❌ Notifications disabled in settings
```
**OR**
```
   ❌ Browser notifications disabled in settings
```

### Step 6: Show Notification (Frontend)
```javascript
new Notification(title, { body, icon, ... })
```

**Browser Console (success)**:
```
   📢 Attempting to show notification: { title: "🔴 Host Down", body: "..." }
   ✅ Showing browser notification
```

**Browser Console (permission issue)**:
```
   ⚠️  Notification permission not granted, requesting...
   ✅ Permission granted, showing notification
```
**OR**
```
   ❌ Browser notifications are blocked. Enable in browser settings.
```

## Notification Channels Summary

### Backend Sends To:

| Channel | Condition | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Discord** | `types.discord.enabled && webhookUrl` | ✅ Working |
| **Telegram** | `types.telegram.enabled && botToken && chatId` | ✅ Working |
| **Slack** | `types.slack.enabled && webhookUrl` | ✅ Working |
| **Webhook** | `types.webhook.enabled && url` | ✅ Working |
| **Email** | `types.email.enabled && smtp.host` | ⚠️ Partial (requires nodemailer) |
| **Browser** | Always broadcasts via WebSocket | ✅ Working |

### Frontend Decides:

- ✅ Check if notifications enabled globally
- ✅ Check if browser notifications enabled
- ✅ Check browser permission status
- ✅ Show notification if all checks pass
